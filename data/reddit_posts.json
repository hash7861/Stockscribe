    "title": "CRWV: AI Rocket or Debt Bomb? Thoughts?",
    "text": "Alright, looked into **CoreWeave (CRWV)**. It's an \"AI Hyperscaler\".. gives GPU (Nvidia) for AI stuff. Stock went nuts since IPO (like 300% up) \u00a0\n\n**Quick Take:** CRWV: Big AI growth, Nvidia likes them. BUT huge debt, only 2 big clients (MSFT, OpenAI), and weird deals with Nvidia & Applied Digital where they invest in each other.\n\n**The Good:**\n\n* **AI Demand:** Selling GPU power for AI. Revenue shot up: $229M (2023) to maybe $8B (2025 est).Q1 2025 rev $981.6M, +420% YoY.\u00a0\n* **Nvidia Favored?** Gets Nvidia's new GPUs (GB200s) early. Nvidia invested, owns \\~7%.\u00a0\n* **Huge Contracts:** $10B Microsoft deal (MSFT is 72% of Q1 rev!).\\~$16B from OpenAI.\u00a0\n* **Stock Surge:** Stock jumped big after IPO from AI hype & news.\u00a0\n\n**The Bad:**\n\n* **Massive Debt:** Over $12.7B raised (equity/debt) by end 2024, liabilities >$18.8B Q1 2025. Interest could be $2B+/year.S-1 said \"material weaknesses in internal control\". Not great. \u00a0\n* **No Profit:** Big revenue, still big losses. Net loss $863M (2024), $314.6M (Q1 2025).\u00a0\n* **Few Customers:** MSFT is 72% of revenue. OpenAI other main one. Risky. \u00a0\n* **Nvidia Reliance:** All GPUs from Nvidia. If Nvidia has issues, CRWV does too. \u00a0\n\n**The Weird Loops:**\n\n* **Nvidia:**\n   * Nvidia investor (\\~7% stake).\u00a0\n   * CRWV buys all GPUs from Nvidia. So NVDA invests, CRWV buys NVDA chips. \u00a0\n   * NVDA *did* pay CRWV for services ($320M deal 2023).Now NVDA says not a customer, and Q1 rev from them <10%. So NVDA invests -> CRWV buys NVDA GPUs -> NVDA *used to* pay CRWV. Circular. \u00a0\n* **Applied Digital (APLD):**\n   * CRWV has \\~$7B, 15yr lease deal with APLD for data centers.\u00a0\n   * CRWV also has warrants for \\~5.5% of APLD. So CRWV is big APLD customer AND investor. \u00a0\n\n**So?**\n\nIs CRWV a smart play with AI giants, or a debt bomb waiting to go off if partners, debt, or AI hype fails? They're racing to make cash from contracts to pay debt & upgrade GPUs before tech gets old.\u00a0\n\nWhat u think? Big win or big fail?\n\n*(NFA, my summary, do ur own DD.)*",

    "title": "Is NVIDIA Getting Too Hot? My Short-Term Concerns with NVDA ($141.92)",
    "text": "I wrote my thesis on Palantir 30 mins before posting this one and looks like folks are not liking it. Long term NVDA could go up. This is purely a short term play. \n\nThis is going to be a similar take to that one. \n\nNVIDIA\u2019s been on an insane run lately. It was up over 20% since mid May and pushing back to all time highs around $142. The AI hype is obviously still alive and well. I genuinely believe AI is the future but still we need to be a bit more realistic.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s making me cautious:\n\n* Options activity is nuts right now \u2014 the $140\u2013$150 calls are getting snapped up like crazy\n* Lots of short-dated call buying, mostly retail\n* The whole \u201cit can\u2019t go down\u201d vibe is creeping back in\n* The stock\u2019s up 10\u201312% straight with barely any pause\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying NVDA is a bad company. It\u2019s a beast, and the AI story is real. But even the strongest stocks usually pull back a bit after a move like this.\n\nI\u2019m looking at a possible short if it pushes into the $143\u2013$145 range. Nothing aggressive, just a trade idea. Thinking we could see a pullback to $135ish (which lines up with the last breakout zone).\n\nIf it breaks above $147 though, I\u2019m out. Could easily rip to $150+ from there.\n\nNot trying to fade the long-term trend here. I am just synthesizing unusual market activity, insider moves, options flow, sentiment, technical and news analysis.\n\nDisclaimer: Not Financial Advice.",

Nvidia has a large stake in the company and it could be profitable next year.

    "text": "Broadcom Corp. said on Tuesday that it has begun shipping its latest networking chip designed to accelerate artificial intelligence.\n\nThe chip, called Tomahawk 6, doubles the performance of its predecessor and has other traffic control features that make the networking chip significantly more efficient, Ram Velaga, Broadcom's senior vice president, said in an interview with Reuters on Monday.\n\nThe increase in speed means fewer network switches are needed to perform the same tasks, Viraga said.\n\nBroadcom's networking chips are becoming increasingly important because of artificial intelligence. In building the data centers needed for AI applications, infrastructure builders must string together hundreds or even thousands of chips.\n\nBuilding large-scale clusters of networking chips requires specialized networking devices and chips, of which the Tomahawk family of processors is one.\n\nWith the Tomahawk 6, Broadcom's engineers have increased its speed and functionality to the point where it can be used to build the larger data centers needed for AI, which can daisy-chain more than 100,000 graphics processors (GPUs), Viraga said.\n\nIn a few years, he said, \u201cyou'll see a million GPUs housed in one physical building.\u201d\n\nBroadcom's networking chips use the Ethernet networking protocol, which has been a networking standard for decades. NVIDIA makes hardware that uses technology from its competitor InfiniBand, as well as several Ethernet-based products.\n\n\u201cAll of these networks can be implemented very simply over Ethernet without the need for esoteric technology,\u201d Velaga said.\n\nThe Tomahawk 6 is the first product in the series to combine multiple chipsets into a single package, a technology known as \u201cchiplets\u201d that has been widely adopted by other chip design companies such as AMD. Velaga said the addition of chiplets roughly doubles the amount of silicon area used in a design. Velaga said the addition of the chiplet roughly doubled the area of silicon used in the design.\n\nBroadcom is using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's three-nanometer process to produce Tomahawk switches.",

Readings above 50 for this index indicate an expansion in activity, while readings below 50 indicate contraction. The manufacturing sector has been in contraction for most of the past two years.\n\nThe import index sank to a reading of 39.9, well below the 47.1 seen in April. The large decrease in imports came as businesses grapple with\u00a0President Trump's tariff hikes\u00a0on various countries. While Trump has recently scaled back some of his initial tariffs,\u00a0a wide swath of levies are still in place.\n\n\u201cImports continue to contract as demand has reduced the need to maintain import levels from previous months, as well as due to the impact of tariff pricing,\u201d Susan Spence, chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee, said in a release.\n\nSpence later told Yahoo Finance in an interview that the biggest concern among ISM panelists was tariffs, with 86% of the responses mentioning levies in their comments. Some respondents compared the current operating environment to the struggles seen during the pandemic in 2020.\n\n\"So the only thing that can help is certainty and whatever is going to finally be happening with the individual countries,\" Spence said.\n\nA separate reading on manufacturing activity from S&P Global, also released on Monday, registered a reading of 52, up from a prior reading of 50.2. But S&P Global chief business economist Chris Williamson wrote in the release that the headline data \"masks worrying developments under the hood\" of the US manufacturing sector.\n\n\"While growth of new orders picked up and suppliers were reportedly busier as companies built up their inventory levels at an unprecedented rate, the common theme was a temporary surge in demand as manufacturers and their customers worry about supply issues and rising prices,\" Williamson wrote.",
