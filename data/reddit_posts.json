    "title": "Is NVIDIA Getting Too Hot? My Short-Term Concerns with NVDA ($141.92)",
    "text": "I wrote my thesis on Palantir 30 mins before posting this one and looks like folks are not liking it. Long term NVDA could go up. This is purely a short term play. \n\nThis is going to be a similar take to that one. \n\nNVIDIA\u2019s been on an insane run lately. It was up over 20% since mid May and pushing back to all time highs around $142. The AI hype is obviously still alive and well. I genuinely believe AI is the future but still we need to be a bit more realistic.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s making me cautious:\n\n* Options activity is nuts right now \u2014 the $140\u2013$150 calls are getting snapped up like crazy\n* Lots of short-dated call buying, mostly retail\n* The whole \u201cit can\u2019t go down\u201d vibe is creeping back in\n* The stock\u2019s up 10\u201312% straight with barely any pause\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying NVDA is a bad company. It\u2019s a beast, and the AI story is real. But even the strongest stocks usually pull back a bit after a move like this.\n\nI\u2019m looking at a possible short if it pushes into the $143\u2013$145 range. Nothing aggressive, just a trade idea. Thinking we could see a pullback to $135ish (which lines up with the last breakout zone).\n\nIf it breaks above $147 though, I\u2019m out. Could easily rip to $150+ from there.\n\nNot trying to fade the long-term trend here. I am just synthesizing unusual market activity, insider moves, options flow, sentiment, technical and news analysis.\n\nDisclaimer: Not Financial Advice.",

    "title": "Nvidia earnings Trump tariff updates, and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge: What to know this week",
    "text": "Stocks' feverish rebound over the past month is now on pause as growing concerns about the fiscal deficit have sent Treasury yields roaring higher and President Trump is once again threatening to escalate tariffs.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Trump threatened to place a direct 25% tariff on Apple products not made in the US while also warning he'd ramp up duties on the European Union to 50% at the start of June. This solidified a week of decline for stocks as the Nasdaq Composite (\\^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (\\^DJI) dropped about 2.4%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (\\^GSPC) slid roughly 2.6% on the week.\n\n\n\nIn the week ahead, updates on the trade war and Trump's pending tax bill will remain in focus, while quarterly results from Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to take center stage on Wednesday after the market close. Reports from Okta (OKTA), Salesforce (CRM), and Costco (COST) will also receive investor attention.\n\n\n\nThe release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge on Friday will headline the economic data schedule. Markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day.\n\n\n\nTariff escalation\n\nPresident Trump's policies have continued to drive markets. Concerns over Trump's tax bill boosting the government deficit have pushed Treasury yields higher. At over 5.1%, the 30-year Treasury yield (\\^TYX) had been hovering near its highest level since 2007, while the 10-year Treasury yield (\\^TNX) had pressed above 4.6%, its highest level since February.\n\n\n\nBut the sell-off in bonds eased on Friday as Trump once again threatened to escalate tariffs, sending a reminder to investors that even with a 90-day tariff pause on a wide swath of countries, the trade policy whipsaw in markets is far from over.\n\n\n\n\"Safe to say for the time being we\u2019ve hit 'trough' trade uncertainty,\" Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"At this point markets need to see these tariffs retracted AND bond yields to not spike again for any material move higher.\"\n\n\n\nFriday's decline in treasuries sent the 10-year below the key 4.5% level Kantrowitz has been watching. As Kantrowitz highlights in the chart below, once the 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5%, interest rate-sensitive stocks have seen increased underperformance in recent years.\n\n\n\nThis played out in last week's market action with the Russell 2000 Index (\\^RUT), which has many companies with more interest rate exposure than the S&P 500, falling nearly 4% compared to the S&P 500's 2.6% decline.\n\n\n\nThe AI leader reports\n\nNvidia is set to report quarterly results on Wednesday after the market close. Investors will be closely watching for any updates on demand from the leading supplier of AI chips. For the quarter, Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.88 on revenue of $43.3 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus data. The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $26 billion in the same period last year.\n\n\n\nGiven Nvidia's position as one of the top holdings in the S&P 500, investors will also be watching how the report affects other tech stocks and the broader market. Shares of Nvidia are roughly flat this year after whipsawing amid growing fears of AI competition and tariff concerns.\n\n\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Nvidia alone has accounted for about 17% of the S&P 500's gains.\n\n\n\nPrice check\n\nTariffs have increased fears that inflation could spike again. But there's been little evidence of a resurgence thus far in economic data, and economists expect a similar story to play out in the coming week.\n\n\n\nA fresh look at a key inflation measure will come on Friday with the April PCE release. Economists project annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.5% in April, down from the 2.6% seen in March. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE at 0.1%, above the 0% seen the month prior.",

If outlook is slightly negative, I believe the market will dump, if its really negative market is going to bleed badly. \n\nCurrently have 1 month out calls on Nvda, Smci, Mrvl.

It's the third time that Nvidia has had to tailor a GPU for the world's second-largest economy after restrictions from U.S. authorities who are keen to stymie Chinese technological development.\n\nAfter the U.S. effectively banned the H20 in April, Nvidia initially considered developing a downgraded version of the H20 for China, sources have said, but that plan didn't work out.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week the company's older Hopper architecture - which the H20 uses - can no longer accommodate further modifications under current U.S. export restrictions.\n\nReuters was unable to determine the product's final name.\n\nChinese brokerage GF Securities said in a note published on Tuesday that the new GPU would likely be called the 6000D or the B40, though it did not disclose pricing or cite sources for the information.\n\nAccording to two of the sources, Nvidia is also developing another Blackwell-architecture chip for China that is set to begin production as early as September. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm specifications of that variant.\n\nNvidia's market share in China has plummeted from 95% before 2022, when U.S. export curbs that impacted its products began, to 50% currently, Huang told reporters in Taipei this week. Its main competitor is Huawei which produces the Ascend 910B chip.\n\nHuang also warned that if U.S. export curbs continue, more Chinese customers will buy Huawei's chips.\n\nThe H20 ban forced Nvidia to write off $5.5 billion in inventory and Huang told the Stratechery podcast on Monday that the company also had to walk away from $15 billion in sales.\n\nThe latest export restrictions introduced new limits on GPU memory bandwidth - a crucial metric measuring data transmission speeds between the main processor and memory chips. This capability is particularly important for AI workloads that require extensive data processing.\n\nInvestment bank Jefferies estimates that the new regulations cap memory bandwidth at 1.7-1.8 terabytes per second. That compares with the 4 terabytes per second that the H20 is capable of.\n\nGF Securities forecast the new GPU will achieve approximately 1.7 terabytes per second using GDDR7 memory technology, just within the export control limits.\n\n",

Oracle has agreed to lease the site for 15 years. Stargate, which incorporated earlier this year, has not invested in the site.\n\nJPMorgan has provided the bulk of the debt financing across two loans totalling $9.6bn, according to people close to the matter, including a $7.1bn loan announced this week. Crusoe and Blue Owl have separately invested around $5bn in cash.\n\nOnce completed, its scale will rival plans by Elon Musk to expand his \u201cColossus\u201d data centre in Memphis, Tennessee, to house around 1mn Nvidia chips. Much of the data centre has so far been built on Nvidia\u2019s earlier H100 and H200 chips, which are less powerful. Musk said this week that the next phase of Colossus would be the \u201cfirst Gigawatt AI training supercluster\u201d. Amazon is building a data centre in northern Virginia that will be larger than 1GW.\n\nThe Abilene data centre is a crucial step in OpenAI\u2019s move to reduce its dependence on Microsoft. Previously, the $300bn-start up has exclusively relied on the US software giant for its computing power, and a large chunk of Microsoft\u2019s near-$14bn investment in OpenAI has come in the form of cloud computing credits.\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft agreed to terminate their exclusivity agreement earlier this year after the start-up became frustrated that its demand for power far exceeded the US tech giant\u2019s supply. The two groups are negotiating to determine how long Microsoft will retain licensing rights to OpenAI\u2019s models.\n\nStargate will play a key role in providing OpenAI\u2019s future computing power. The high-profile venture, billed as a huge infrastructure project to boost the US AI industry, is raising $100bn to spend on data centre projects, with the figure rising to as much as $500bn over the next four years.\n\nOpenAI and SoftBank have each committed $18bn to Stargate, which was unveiled in January by US President Donald Trump. Oracle and MGX, an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, committed a further $7bn each, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe four groups will hold equity stakes in the project, with SoftBank and OpenAI the majority owners, according to a second person with knowledge of the matter. Stargate has not committed capital to any data centre project so far.\n\nOpenAI has also expanded its Stargate project overseas, with plans to build a massive data centre in the UAE that was announced as part of Trump\u2019s Gulf tour last week. The 10 sq mile UAE-US AI campus, located in Abu Dhabi and built by Emirati AI company G42, is planned to have 5GW of data centre power \u2014 equivalent to more than 2mn of AI chipmaker Nvidia\u2019s latest generation of GB200 chips.\n\nOracle did not immediately respond to a request for comment. JPMorgan and OpenAI declined to comment.",
